# Description:

This project implements a neural network model using Keras to predict credit defaulters based on a dataset of financial features. The model aims to identify potential borrowers who are likely to default on loans, helping financial institutions mitigate risks and make informed lending decisions.

## Key Features:

### Data Preprocessing:

Handles missing values, normalization, and feature selection to enhance model performance.
Splits the dataset into training and testing subsets for validation purposes.

### Neural Network Architecture:

Builds a fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with multiple hidden layers.
Utilizes activation functions like ReLU and softmax to improve learning capabilities.

### Model Training:

Compiles the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers (e.g., Adam).
Implements early stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure robust training.

### Evaluation Metrics:

Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizes training history with loss and accuracy plots to monitor model performance.

### Predictive Insights:

Generates predictions on unseen data to assess the likelihood of default.
Provides a detailed analysis of feature importance, helping stakeholders understand key factors influencing credit risk.
This project serves as a practical application of machine learning in finance, demonstrating how advanced analytics can enhance decision-making in credit risk assessment.
